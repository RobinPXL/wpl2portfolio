                'excellent
                professional'. This model includes four core values: (em)passion, entrepreneurial & innovative,
                (international) co-working, and (multi)disciplinary. In the following sections, I reflect on my
                experiences
                in relation to each of these core values.</p>

                    <h3 class="subTitle greenText">(Em)passion</h3>
                    <p>During this course, I discovered my interest in design, specifically in creating a brand
                        identity. Completing a brand guide and seeing the various applications of the brand provides me
                        with a huge energy-boost and enthusiasm to start a new project. Not every phase is equally
                        interesting,
                        but all are crucial to achieving a beautiful result. This process no longer intimidates me. I
                        also gained insight into how much time it takes to create an (almost) perfect style guide.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <h3 class="subTitle greenText">Entrepreneurial & Innovative</h3>
                    <p>Learning new tools such as Jira and Confluence was interesting. I found it fascinating to have
                        the freedom to document the steps of the process as deeply or descriptively as I wanted. Some
                        pages are quite detailed,
                        describing the thought process and achieved results. In an Agile Scrum environment,
                        self-direction is the goal, but in practice, it was helpful to have someone make decisions or
                        guide the team in the right direction. This responsibility often naturally fell onto me, but it
                        also regularly shifted to other team members, especially when they had more expertise in a
                        particular area.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <h3 class="subTitle greenText">Co-working and (networking)</h3>
                    <p>I always thought I was good at collaborating, but I had never done it for such an extended
                        period. This revealed some areas for improvement, such as motivating myself and others during
                        'slower periods', better managing my work time, and staying within the scope. Fortunately, I
                        noticed these points and worked on them during this semester. For example, I used Jira more
                        frequently and did more preparatory work. To stay within scope, I had more conversations with my
                        fellow students and regularly reviewed the deliverables.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <h3 class="subTitle greenText">(Multi)disciplinary</h3>
                    <p>I have less to say about this component as I have more experience with the hard skills required
                        for this project. I could contribute at any time to the website's development or offer tips on
                        social media strategies. As a point of interest, in my free time, I often read blogs and posts
                        from
                        graphic designers sharing tips on workflows and shortcuts in certain apps. I found some mock-up
                        websites to share with my group, as well as some fonts to try for the logo. The results from the
                        collaboration within my group seemed quite professional. I am happy to have worked on this
                        project with such talented people.</p>

                    <p>The goal of this course is to simulate the daily tasks and workflow of our future job. We also
                        work with real clients
                        and must present and execute a complete project. Naturally, we do not work alone; we are
                        assigned to groups. Everyone has a different view and opinion about the work, and it is
                        important to stay as aligned as possible.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <h3 class="subTitle pinkText">Task</h3>
                    <p>My task within this project became clear after a small team-building session with my group. I
                        focused mainly on the design work and offered support/help to the developer when needed. This
                        task description is quite broad because several people focused on the design aspect. This meant
                        that misunderstandings or uncertainties could arise due to significant differences of opinion.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <h3 class="subTitle pinkText">Action</h3>
                    <p>As agreed, I spent most of my work designing the brand guide. At the beginning of the branding
                        process, I was not alone; some members helped me with the logo and color palette. We worked on
                        this for several days, even an entire sprint, leading to many discussions. For instance, we
                        disagreed on the direction of the logo design, and some people requested an alternative palette
                        with more blue. I also planned and conducted brainstorming sessions with the team several times
                        to clarify everything.</p>
                    <p>My group and I spent at least an hour daily on a general conversation. We did this not only to
                        see how everyone was personally doing but also to gauge the project's progress informally. In
                        the afternoon, we also had a session to see where the group's energy was after lunch. By the
                        middle of sprint 3, all the tasks and workflows were aligned and cohesive. Additionally, I
                        collaborated
                        with the lead developer for several days and offered help where needed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <h3 class="subTitle pinkText">Result</h3>
                    <p>The brainstorming sessions helped enormously and saved time. We resolved our disagreements by
                        making compromises. Our coaches often helped by guiding our work in the right direction and
                        providing constructive feedback. According to the jury, the client, and ourselves, this project
                        was completed amazingly. The client had a few comments, for example we used some unnecessary
                        gradients
                        on photos, but overall, the clients and we were very pleased with the result. Personally, I look
                        forward to working on projects with this group more often.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <h3 class="subTitle pinkText">Reflection</h3>
                    <p>What went very well during this collaboration was the polite yet friendly interaction of everyone
                        involved. This created enjoyable moments and made sure no one felt excluded. We divided the
                        tasks well and always kept everyone informed of changes or other important announcements. I also
                        appreciated that people spoke up, for example, when someone would be late or forgot items like a
                        mouse or post-its.</p>
                    <p>What could be improved was keeping track of and documenting our work. We had to stop several
                        times to update Confluence. At such moments, it is normal to forget some steps or thought
                        processes. Additionally, we created strange burndown charts several times due to our lax
                        timekeeping on Jira and Confluence. We often forgot to drag completed tasks to 'done', for
                        example.</p>
                    <p>In the beginning, we also struggled with processing feedback, especially because communication
                        with the client was not always present, and we did not know for a long time if we were on the
                        right track. Fortunately, this was resolved by better communication in the later sprints. Our
                        client could then contact us more regularly. And subsequently our ability to recieve feedback
                        improved.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <h3 class="subTitle pinkText">Transfer</h3>
                    <p>In the future, I will use a concrete notebook or tool to list my tasks, keep track of deadlines,
                        and note deliverables. These tasks were largely done by the teachers, and it was very handy to
                        have an overall plan. Of course, that won't be the case every time.</p>
                    <p>To process feedback, I will visit my colleagues and coaches (if any) more often to see what I
                        need to focus on or improve. It is easier to ask short questions than to schedule an hour to
                        improve work in broad strokes.</p>

                        worked on several pages of the website and learned new Vue.js practices. Additionally, I
                        completely remade my portfolio, and the style now suits me better.</p>

                    <p>On certain days, my expectations of the project fluctuated. I feared the website would not be
                        finished on time and would not be responsive, that the social media campaign would not have a
                        concrete strategy, or that the documentation would not be in order. Fortunately, many of these
                        thoughts remained just thoughts, and we eventually delivered a lot of great work. I mentioned
                        other difficulties earlier in this document.

                        because the team was very motivating and allowed me to take it easy and communicate openly about
                        my frustrations. As I mentioned earlier, I should keep a planner to ensure a good workflow. This
                        way, I forget less and can remind myself of what was requested.</p>
