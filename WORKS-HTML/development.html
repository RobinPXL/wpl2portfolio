            <p class="col-md-6">Front-end development is something I want to get into slowly on my own terms. I know in
                regard to programming and more 'logical' or abstract knowledge I can lack behind in an academic setting.
                Additionally I really like to take a break from strictly design works and 'relax' by doing some code.

                <p>For my former work (de Aanstokerij VZW) I was tasked with making essentially a boardgame calculator.
                    I have mostly finished the code, expect the final round. In that round every continent/nation fuses
                    together to achieve the sustainability goals set out for each of them. </p>
                <p>I would have finished this project earlier if I wasn't as interested in the design and social media
                    aspect at de Aanstokerij. Learning that I over-commited to things and had a hard time saying no
                    crushed me. If I could turn back time, I would have declined certain works to focus my time on this
                    project. Despite this somewhat defeat, I did learn a great deal and hope to apply it to things to
                    come. I don't think learning development in a 'traditional setting' with teachers does it for me.
                    Which is strange, because that always did work for me. Something like a study group with a
                    continuous work cycle would do me wonders in learning more about development.

                <p>As a way to test my recent HTML and CSS technicalities (bootstrap 4 too), I made a decorative code
                    for users on a website called toyhou.se. I had a lot of fun and I hoped it would be a succes within
                    that community. Sadly, it wasn't nearly as popular or lucrative as my other endeavors on this
                    website.</p>
                <p>I've wanted to create a simple HTML code with inline CSS (because I don't have the premium version
                    for the non-inline CSS editor). It was a fun little afternoon and it gave me new followers on the
                    site.

                <h2 class="subTitle pinkText text-center">Night City profile decoration</h2>
                <p>Another code for Toyhouse, this time it was part of a challenge within the community called Coding
                    quarters. The challenge was to encapsulate a little text or info box with different gifs and images.
                    I chose to use footage of the video game Cyberpunk.</p>
                <p>Night city is such a cool place and I absolutely love the cyberpunk genre. Knowing that this game
                    (Cyberpunk 77) is based on a TTRP by similar name is really exciting! I've downloaded a PDF not long
                    ago to read about it and perhaps inplement some pieces of it in my own work.This Toyhouse code was
                    part of a Coding Quarters challenge, a coding community challenge basically. I wanted to use footage
                    of the aforementioned game because they just are really cool and I wanted to pay a simple tribute to
                    the dystopian city. For people who are more knowledgeable about TTRPG's might recognise aspects of
                    another game called Vampire the Masquerade.

                <h2 class="subTitle blueText text-center">Lilith: Queen of the night</h2>
                <p>This code was particularly popular with the artists on toyhouse who were into mythology and writing
                    long entries about their characters. This decorative code launched my account into a
                    'micro-celebrity' status within the coding community there.</p>
                <p>The text and image were found on Pinterest and I thought it had a really cool lay-out, so I wanted to
                    make it into a template that could be re-used for any kind of deity. Many people from the mythology
                    fandom kind of flocked to my code and pinged me in many creations. It was actually really sweet of
                    them to ping me and show me their awesome works. I've also seen a fair share of 'frankencodes', the
                    practice of stitching different creator's code into one page/lay-out.
