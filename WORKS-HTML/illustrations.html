            <p class="col-md-6">Ever since I was 10 years old, I drew all kinds of things. I have a strong affinity with
                creatures of all kinds. My illustrations focus on color, rendering, composition and detail work. This is
                only a small sample, the best place to check out my works would be on <a class="blueText"

                <p>I really tried to focus on the lighting and the shading of this piece. The part I'm most proud of is
                    the implementation of 2 light sources that don't fight for each other's attention.</p>
                <p>Originally I wanted to make it in an Aztec like art work, but because I was traveling at the time I
                    had no reference to base it off of. I didn't want to lose any time and just continued working with
                    natural colors and really focus on the lighting here.

                <p>This boardgame captured my heart and soul! I spent my entire summer of 2022 entirely engrossed in it.
                    Of course, I wanted to draw all the creatures. This inspired me and a lot of people on Reddit for me
                    to continue to illustrate these woodland creatures in multiple ways. </p>
                <p>This game had captured me for the entire summer of 2022. I had an absolute blast making fan-art for
                    both the official board game: Root the game of Might and RIght, but also the podcast that played
                    TTRP called: Root, a game of Might, Right and ... Arson! I listened to three episodes and I really
                    like their characters. I drew every single one and put them all in one big illustration/banner.

                <p>Ever since I got my spotify account 2 years ago, I've been creating playlists left and right.
                    Sometimes it's difficult to find a specific playlist if they overlapping artists. That's why I made
                    my own 'album' covers to make it easier to find.</p>
                <p>The inspiration and motivation to create my own spotify album/playlist covers was by my all time
                    favourite artist: Kyle Ferrin. Kyle Ferrin is a board game illustrator and his specialty lies in
                    drawing doodly creatures. He mostly uses ink and bright popping colors. I thought I should also draw
                    a cover within my own specialties. I love night scenes and woodland animals, but my style has that
                    purple magical flair to it.

                <p>I had to get to a dentist appointment once and I was a bit too early. So I decided to grab a coffee
                    in a nearby alley. That's how I found this vvery cosy café near the Avenue de Volxem, Forest.</p>
                <p>I sat down and began drawing a table in front of me. It had some delicious croissants in front of it
                    and I thought that it would be a fun challenge to draw it. Looking through my brushes, I wanted to
                    experiment with tools that I haven't used much before. I had a lot of fun using the 'Nico Bull'
                    brush.
