            <p class="col-md-6">Creating designs for both real and imaginary clients brings me immense joy. The
                satisfaction of knowing
                that something not only functions effectively but also looks visually appealing fills me with excitement
                and a sense of inner peace. My ultimate goal is to bring happiness and inspiration to others through my
                work. I aspire to evoke a tender, childlike sense of wonder in my audience.</p>

                <h2 class="subTitle blueText text-center">Story of sharks</h2>
                <p>For Data Visualisation at PXL, I was assigned to make an infographic about a current societal
                    problem. I chose to make a story about our apex predator: the shark.</p>
                <p>I worked for 3 days on the illustrations of sharks, slicing them away from images on Unsplash and
                    adding my own twists to them. It was so satisfying when everything came together. The colors, the
                    compostion and the text made it all so exciting to look at. My poster helped some people to get over
                    their fear of sharks and be advocates for them instead. I think this worked out absolutely amazing!

                <h2 class="subTitle greenText text-center">Nectosia</h2>
                <p>For my design course, I had to create a fantasy brand that would cater to the hero of a movie, video
                    game or book. I chose for the character Zagreus in the video game Hades.</p>
                <p>Working on this project gave me a flush of creativity. It took me quite a bit to find a subject
                    matter, however. At the time I was obsessed with the video game Hades from the developers
                    'Supergiant Games'. It's taking inspiration from Greek mythology but with a modern sympathy and
                    understanding for the denizens of the Underworld.

                <h2 class="subTitle pinkText text-center">Cuddle Bug</h2>
                <p>For my design course, I had to create a new way to transfer audio files just like back in the day
                    with mix tapes. We turned a cuddly bear into the perfect music gift for little brothers.</p>
                <p>I really like listening to music and I have always liked the idea of making a playlist for the people
                    I like. Music and its endless bounds tug at the heartstrings of both young and old. So in this
                    assignment we decided to dedicate it to, me and my partner at the time Rebecca Rosies, our younger
                    brothers. We want them to know how much we love them and how often we think of them.

                <p>For my design case, I needed to figure out a way to bring vulnerable youths of Brussels into its
                    cultural heart. If we needed people to fall in love with culture, then we had to start flirting in
                    the streets. </p>
                <p>Doing research about this group in some cases felt sad. It was disheartening to hear and read about
                    the situations they were in and felt unloved and unappreciated by institutions, fellow people and
                    some even by their own community. I understood that they saw art and culture as something they just
                    didn't get included in or it felt in a way foreign like you need to know a lot about it. Because of
                    that I wanted to make sure that the posters came over as inviting and non-judgemental as possible.
